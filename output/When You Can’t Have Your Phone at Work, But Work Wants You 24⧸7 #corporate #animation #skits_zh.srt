[中文翻译] team I just quickly want to reiterate cell phones are not permitted to be out at  your desk okay let me say that again cell phones are not permitted to be out at  your desk we deal with a lot of sensitive information we don't want to  compromise a client's account so cell phones are not permitted at your desk it's  in the guidelines we explained it to you when you were hired and you agreed to  it so I've been seeing cell phones out I just want to make sure that we're all on  the same page okay Veronica can I see you before you leave the meeting thank  you thank you for staying behind Veronica I just need to talk to you about  something we've tried to contact you a couple times at home about some time  sensitive matters and it looks like you're not responding you never respond when  we try to communicate with you I've tried email texting I've even tried calling  a few times and it's just impossible to get a hold of you can you shed some light  on why no problem yeah I'm happy to shed some light on it I'm providing my  family the same courtesy that I'm providing you while I'm here at work so when  I'm at work as you just mentioned in the meeting I'm not allowed to have my  phone I'm not allowed to check in on my family and make sure that they're okay  which I understand we we do deal with sensitive information so when I'm at  home with them I'm not doing anything that's work related my contract as you  mentioned says nine to five so after five I'm unavailable did you did you want  to see the contract no I don't need you to show me your contract how do we fix  this because I we need to be able to contact you there's always a solution so  you can provide me a company cell phone and pay me from five to midnight I  don't assume that you're gonna have to contact me after midnight and I will be  more than happy to be available but I will need my same salary from five to  midnight as well as the company cell phone we can't do that we can't pay you  indefinitely and we can't provide a cell phone it's more of sort of being a team  player if that makes sense I'm sure it makes sense to someone but I'm available  nine to five you can pay me for my time after that if you need me to be  available but no I'm not giving up time with my family my alone time I'm not  giving up my time outside of this office to you for any for anything so I am  a team player from nine to five Monday through Friday  okay thank you
